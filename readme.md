BubbleSets for JavaScript
=========================

This is a JavaScript implementation of [bubble sets](http://faculty.uoit.ca/collins/research/bubblesets/)
without the use of external libraries. A Java implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/JosuaKrause/Bubble-Sets).

Usage:

```javascript
var bubbles = new BubbleSet();
// bubbles can be reused for subsequent runs or different sets of rectangles
var list = bubbles.createOutline(rectangles, otherRectangles, null /* lines */);
// rectangles needs to be a list of objects of the form { x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0 }
// lines needs to be a list of objects of the form { x1: 0, x2: 0, y1: 0, y2: 0 }
// lines can be null to infer lines between rectangles automatically
var outline = "";
list.forEach(function(p) {
  if(!outline.length) {
    outline += "M " + p[0] + " " + p[1];
  } else {
    outline += " L " + p[0] + " " + p[1];
  }
});
if(outline.length) {
  outline += " Z";
}
// outline is a path that can be used for the attribute d of a path element
```

This is a one-to-one translation of the Java code. If you're missing a feature from the Java version or find a bug please open an [issue](https://github.com/JosuaKrause/bubblesets-js/issues/new). [Pull requests](https://github.com/JosuaKrause/bubblesets-js/compare) are also welcome.
