BubbleSets for JavaScript
=========================

This is a JavaScript implementation of [bubble sets](http://faculty.uoit.ca/collins/research/bubblesets/)
without the use of external libraries. A Java implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/JosuaKrause/Bubble-Sets).

**This is a work in progress and NOT yet working... Stay tuned!**

For now this will be a one-to-one translation of the Java code.
More changes to come after that.
